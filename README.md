# password_checker
This code has been writter to check when your password has been pawned or not.
https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords can used to check the same. However sharing your password to third parties wouldn't be a good idea
Instead using https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/ api and passing query in python would give the same result
Code is written in python and can be run using "python <filename>.py <password>"
